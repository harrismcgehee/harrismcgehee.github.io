I needed to create a multi-sheet Excel workbook for a collaborator to review the most common comments fields. Luckily, I remembered that `writexl::write_xlsx` can do just that if you pass a list in as the first argument.  Even more luckily, I saw a tweet from Jenny Bryan earlier this week about `tibble::deframe`.

From the documentation:

  > deframe() converts **two-column data frames** to a named vector or **list**, using the first column as name and the second column as value.

## Load packages:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
library(writexl)
```

## Create the thing that I want collaborator to see:

```{r}
counts <- ggplot2::diamonds %>% 
  dplyr::count(color, cut) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(color, desc(n)) %>% 
  print()
```

## Convert to list object

Here, we are tucking the data into a single column with `tidyr::nest()`. Then we `deframe()` the sheets `tibble` into the list.

```{r}
sheets <- counts %>% 
  tidyr::nest(-cut, .key = "these_get_printed_in_excel") %>%
  print() 

sheets_list <- tibble::deframe(sheets)
str(sheets_list)
```

## Out the door

The `sheets_list` is the perfect structure for these multi-sheet Excel workbooks.

```{r}
writexl::write_xlsx(sheets_list) %>% invisible()
```

ps. I've been enjoying this `%>% invisible()` in my `.Rmd` recently when I don't want to comment out code, but I don't want to print anything. It is a nicer than having to hop up into the r chunk options.

Thoughts?
